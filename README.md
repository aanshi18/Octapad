The project consists of two parts:

(1) Generating musical note for each pad present in a drum set
- Through scilab we have generated the sound files.
- Scilab helped in generating the sound for each pad through ADSR envelope.

(2) Making user interface and fixing each note in each pad.
- The java files contains octapad GUI where a person can play various tunes through touching on each pad.
